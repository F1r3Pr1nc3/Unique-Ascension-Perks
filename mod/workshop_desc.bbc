Since an updated MOD was sorely missed, some rework has been done, over 600 issues have been fixed. Increased compatibility/performance and fixed [strike](probably) all[/strike]last known bugs.

This version is kept separated from the original for testing new or reworked features. So this mod is updated more frequently (more or less always WiP, so multiplayer is not recommended with this branch) you should report any bug. I’ll try to fix them as soon as possible. For more info, see the [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1693982756/3423312514214790779/][u]FEATURES[/u][/url] list.

[h3]⚠️ [b]Current Known Perk Issues[/b] ⚠️[/h3]
[i]Fixes in progress…[/i]
[strike]• Lost Heritage (hyperline overlap while mass-generated / no hyperlines)[/strike]
[strike]• United Awareness ("veteran" trait blocked)[/strike] - needs confirmation
• Space Domestication (re-creation problems) - needs confirmation
• Aggressive Marketing - needs more info (not compat with E&C BB)
[strike]• Center of Galaxy (specific issue on some players, perks is still operational in game)[/strike]
[strike]• Primitive Creation (problem with generation)[/strike]
[strike]• Light of Eternity (minor - you "technically" should not have more than 21 void-clouds, anything else fine)[/strike]
[strike]• Deep Space Scanner (minor - require manual click each time on colony to create new anomaly)[/strike]
[strike]• Archaeological Experts (not create digs time-to-time)[/strike] - half done
