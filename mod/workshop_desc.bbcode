Since the old MOD was sorely missed, some rework has been done, over 600 issues have been fixed. Increased compatibility/performance and fixed [strike](probably) all[/strike]last known bugs.

This version is kept separated from the original for testing new or reworked features. So this mod is more or less always WiP (so multiplayer is not recommended with this branch) you should report any bug. I'll try to fix them as soon as possible. For more info see the [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1693982756/3423312514214790779/][u]FEATURES[/u][/url] list.
