 AnomaliesRespawnEvent.2001.Desc: "It appears that some planets in our territory which did not show any anomalous readings when we surveyed them were actually hiding some interesting anomalies which our scientists missed during the initial survey."
 AnomaliesRespawnEvent.2001.Name: "§BNew Anomalies Discovered§!"
 NewAnomalyEvents.100.Desc: "The rotational velocity relative to the galactic plane of this star is not consistent with other A class stars encountered before. After a long observational period the crew tried to describe that unprecedented behavior and to the surprise of the scientific crew, all movement of that star could only be compared to that of a lost cell idling in space. Could it be proof that our universe may be infinitely big?"
 NewAnomalyEvents.100.Name: "A Star moving like a Cell"
 NewAnomalyEvents.110.Desc: "The composition of this B class is unique, and it appears that a simple beam of laser is able to create a strange thermal disruption within the star leaving a permanent mark. In the end our scientist crew decided to add the great name of our civilization in order to prove to the next generations coming in the future millennia's that we were present and advanced enough to discover such an amazing process."
 NewAnomalyEvents.110.Name: "Writable Star"
 NewAnomalyEvents.111.Desc: "After sending pictures of that new discovered star to our people it appears that many influential people in our society want to have their name put on that star. The buzz created by this B-class star was strong enough to generate some influence along the way."
 NewAnomalyEvents.111.Name: "The Star of the Stars"
 NewAnomalyEvents.120.Desc: "At the first it sounds very illogical but after vigorous inspection we can confirm that this star is acting like a living organism, and is able to clear interstellar debris from orbit and to resist the huge heat coming from itself. We can only speculate that it is trying to maintain a consistent appearance, but why?"
 NewAnomalyEvents.120.Name: "Living Star"
 NewAnomalyEvents.130.Desc: "An abandoned energy harvesting station composed of unknown material of unprecedented strength has been located near this G class star, and it seems to have been deactivated for an unknown amount of time. Our scientific staff wasn't able to activate it again but we found a large stockpile of energy which was probably constructed in order to keep the station active even after the death of that star. Since this won't happen for billions of years we decided to use that energy for our own purposes instead."
 NewAnomalyEvents.130.Name: "Energy Station"
 NewAnomalyEvents.140.Desc: "We have located a very weak signal coming from this K class star, and it appears that an engineering outpost has been detected directly inside the star. But the most interesting part is the fact that some people of an unknown species are inside and don't seem to like having us around for a long time. As they somehow presume that we can't reach or hurt them despite our warnings about Star-Eaters, Nicoll-Dyson Beams, Quasi-Stellar Obliterators and Blokkats, they decided to share some interesting engineering data in exchange for leaving them and never returning."
 NewAnomalyEvents.140.Name: "Engineers Inside"
 NewAnomalyEvents.150.Desc: "A peculiar drifting box has been located near this M class star, composed of materials unseen. Surprisingly, a related reinvestigation of the Star reveals that it had once been endothermic, burning cold instead of hot! Besides that the Box featured a very weak security system which allowed us to open it very easily, finding gorgeous treasures and technological marvels along with three frozen humanoid corpses inside, presumably from a time when the star had been endothermic."
 NewAnomalyEvents.150.Name: "Frozen History"
 NewAnomalyEvents.151.Desc: "This M class star is somehow able to create an attractive magnetic field at least strong enough to capture most of the mineral dust, around forming a mineral cloud big enough to be harvested."
 NewAnomalyEvents.160.Desc: "A weak signal came from a very small passage near that black hole. After a closer inspection we found something so horrific and repulsive that it is impossible to describe it with words. The crew is convinced that the monster was trying to reach our galaxy. Luckily, our scientific team kept their heads cool and managed to close the small gate linking us to the realm of that horror by launching a projectile at a very high speed which quickly created a chain reaction with the energy of the black hole and sealed the passage forever. Only one concerning garbled message ever made it through: 'Ummmm... Friends?'"
 NewAnomalyEvents.160.Name: "Forgotten Bane"
 NewAnomalyEvents.170.Desc: "This pulsar is much larger than most of the ones we previously encountered, and the energy coming out of it is exceptional. It only took a few days for the engineering team to create a solar panel-esque device which managed to absorb a lot of energy and is now ready to be exploited for us on regular intervals."
 NewAnomalyEvents.170.Name: "Super Pulsar"
 NewAnomalyEvents.180.Desc: "This solar system is very rich in mineral dust but the particles are very small and gathering them all would take centuries. Yet our science crew had an interesting an idea: They knew that the mineral dust can be attracted with the help of the neutron star with this magnetic attraction and that they could simply stimulate the attracting field to bundle the dust into usable chunks. Using this technique, we managed to gather a huge amount of minerals, now ready to be collected."
 NewAnomalyEvents.180.Name: "Attractive Profits"
 NewAnomalyEvents.190.Desc: "No scientifically valuable traces of the previous civilization which once inhabited this planet have been found during the initial survey, but some beautiful and valuable pieces of art which could be sold at high value to collectors have been detected by the resurveying team!"
 NewAnomalyEvents.190.Name: "Art from the Ashes"
 NewAnomalyEvents.191.Desc: "We have found a huge databank which is still active yet badly damaged, and unfortunately the only coherent information that we were able to extract were logs about some sort of special method on how to influence the population and their factions in order to attract them to the governments ideals. An interesting find."
 NewAnomalyEvents.191.Name: "Fragmented Information"
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.Desc: "Some kind of large-scale disaster seems to have happened on this once-thriving planet and its now derelict cities, yet the only suspicious things present are their clothes, which only feature different shades of gray and lie scattered all over the planets settlements. Additionally, the apparently nanite-infused material of these clothes doesn't seem to be affected by the eons of time that have passed and seem to regenerate from any damage using material nearby could potentially be useful for us. The only clue regarding the inhabitants fate we found was a note in a citizen's sealed pocket which claims that the 'True Ones' which stand 'enlightened by the sun' would fight together and with unity until the end when the last one of the 'Soul-eating Nanite scum' were finally exposed and destroyed. It is impossible to say today who their enemy was but something certain is the fact that we should take example of their bravery, even though they perished in the end."
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.Name: "Faded Grays"
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.a: "We will honor them."
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.b: "Take the clothes and leave."
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.Desc: "The inhabitants of these society seemingly lived in near-utopian living standards with lifespans far beyond our most venerable organics thanks to ever-evolving medical care based on creative uses of volatile motes, with a planet spanning pipeline network connecting every building to their main chemical plants. Yet something forced them to abandon their planet very very quickly before they had the time to take all their fortune with them. We won't be able to take all the treasures that they left behind and several ships of what appear to be smugglers and pirates have been spotted en route, which means that they are going to loot everything remaining here. We must leave as soon as possible, so what are we going to do?"
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.Name: "Fallen Utopia"
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.a: "Take the credits!"
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.b: "Retrieve all valuable minerals!"
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.c: "Retrieve the motes!"
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.d: "We won't let the smugglers have any of this. Ignite the pipeline network."
 NewAnomalyEvents.200.Desc: "The corpse of this colossus was fascinating, and our scientific crew was not even able to explain how exactly this very strange creature functioned. The only thing we could do was to give an estimation of its lifespan and age by analysing the creature's skeleton. It turns out that the creature has lived for over 10000 years before dying from what the scientists presume to be a battle with a rather large Tiyanki. Such a discovery will help us a lot in our understanding of biology."
 NewAnomalyEvents.200.Name: "Advanced Creature"
 NewAnomalyEvents.201.Desc: "We have found something very fascinating on the surface of the creatures body: It appears that the skin is entirely composed of some sort of crystalline structure resembling what would commonly be found in jewellery. It is able to resist decomposition and fused with the rest of the body, yet it is hard to determine if these jewels are natural or if they are the result of collision with space debris. In the end, the findings were inconclusive and actual applications near-impossible and our science team opted to sell them to a collector for research funding instead."
 NewAnomalyEvents.201.Name: "Skin of Jewels"
 NewAnomalyEvents.202.Desc: "We have detected some activity inside the dead space organism. After a long discussion about the potential dangers, the crew decided to open a hole large enough to check what is inside without allowing it break free. In an interesting turn of events, it turns out that there are passive Tiyanki Space Whale Calves inside. The most interesting part is the fact that they seemed to thank us for helping them to break free by doing a sort of odd dance, and decided to follow the science ship, potentially confusing it for its mother which will help us with the study of their species."
 NewAnomalyEvents.202.Name: "Tiyankis Inside"
 NewAnomalyEvents.203.Desc: "In a striking discovery our science team concluded that the corpse of the creature is somehow still regenerating to some capacity! While its central nervous system has long ceased to function the body itself is still using what remains of its energy reserves to regenerate. After the initial autopsy attempts, our scientists concluded that we could potentially use a similar artificially engineered tissue to enhance our hulls, which would give them regenerative abilities."
 NewAnomalyEvents.203.Name: "Regenerating Corpse"
 NewAnomalyEvents.204.Desc: "Some abandoned corvettes were found inside of the creature, and it seems that the actual combat ended before they became trapped in its stomach. They are in miraculously good conditions considering the circumstances and may be reused by our own navy."
 NewAnomalyEvents.204.Name: "Abandoned Ships"
 NewAnomalyEvents.210.Desc: "A very durable gate was found near the location pinpointed by the astrocartographic chart, locked by a primitive security code. While breaking it would have token near to no effort, it was simple to deduce that the astrocartographic chart would lead us to that code anyways, with more potential research opportunities along the way. We managed to locate the code in what seem to be ruins of a primitive capital building, extracting some valuable civilisatory data along the way and allowing us to access the vault without brute force. Surprisingly enough, the vault contained a stash of galactic standard energy credits, which while a bit confusing can easily be used as any other credit."
 NewAnomalyEvents.210.Name: "Vault of Credits"
 NewAnomalyEvents.211.Desc: "The astrocartographic chart gave us the location of an abandoned treasure, and while it has no potential for industrial or scientific applications, it still has some value in our modern market, especially for collectors of jewels and artifacts. "
 NewAnomalyEvents.211.Name: "Abandoned Treasure"
 NewAnomalyEvents.212.Desc: "The astrocartographic chart gave us the location of an abandoned primitive structure which appeared to be some sort of robotics factory, even though their civilisation should not have even developed anything near that tech-level for at least a century. We have found an ancient machine of a very crude design inside which challenged us to a game which seemed to be analogous to 'chess' from our own civilization. After losing some rounds against it despite our best efforts, we finally managed to defeat the machine which gave us some blueprints to let us know how these primitive engineers managed to develop artificial intelligence so soon as a reward."
 NewAnomalyEvents.212.Name: "The Improbable AI"
 NewAnomalyEvents.213.Desc: "The astrocartographic chart we found gave us the location of a giant deactivated powerplant. After turning it on the amount of energy generated from it was significant enough for the engineering crew to recommend that we should exploit it from space with a mining station."
 NewAnomalyEvents.213.Name: "The Power Plant"
 NewAnomalyEvents.220.Desc: "A giant spaceborne alien was found trapped in the micro-wormhole, and while of unknown origin it was clearly negatively affected by the wormhole, with life signs decreasing at a semi-continuous rate. If nothing had been done the creature would have likely been killed and the research opportunity lost. After a close inspection of the wormhole the crew determined that the giant spaceborne alien wasn't hostile and so they decided to help it escape with the help of a grappling hook and the thrusters of the science vessel. The rescue was a very satisfying and inspiring endeavor for the crew and the creature rewarded them with a lavishly beautiful sound afterwards, estimated to be an expression of gratitude by the Xenobiology department. The crew remained motionless, stunned by its performance and allowed the little creature to escape back into the void, while trying to grasp the potential impact of their accomplishment on this region of space."
 NewAnomalyEvents.220.Name: "Trapped Alien"
 NewAnomalyEvents.221.Desc: "A strange device was found on the other side of the micro-wormhole. It seems near-impossible to explain the main purpose of the object, but it seems to be some sort of dimensional energy and matter harvesting device for assembly of physical objects that has somehow lost its active link to the dimension it was connected to. Additionally, the secondary purpose of it was to function as some sort of multi-tool kit with a large number of functions."
 NewAnomalyEvents.221.Name: "A Strange Device"
 NewAnomalyEvents.222.Desc: "A beautifully glistering sapphire has been found on the other side of the micro-wormhole, the sapphire being close in size to an average Blorg. The crew determined that it could be collected, even though they still have no idea how or why that jewel ended up in there. After an analysis showed that it was unfit for industrial or military applications, we opted to sell it to a Private collector instead."
 NewAnomalyEvents.222.Name: "Journeying Sapphire"
 NewAnomalyEvents.223.Desc: "In the end the mini-wormhole turned out to be artificial and the source of it was quickly spotted by our engineers after that realisation. A strange decrepit device obscured by dust and broken machinery, connected to a network of interlinked fusion reactors which had long failed, with only some sort of reserve battery complex remaining, likely explains why the wormhole was so small and continuously shrinking. With the surrounding machinery to damaged to be repaired or even analysed for anything useful the crew decided to extract the rest of the energy remaining since a half-broken wormhole generator consuming it for no good reason would yield nothing."
 NewAnomalyEvents.223.Name: "Unknown Generator"
 NewAnomalyEvents.230.Desc: "The crew finally managed to hack the lone computer. It appears that somehow, even after thousands of years the session of the one who was on that computer beforehand remained open thanks to a vast network of underground geothermal generators out of which few -yet some- still seem to be running. Decrepit construction sites litter hallways deeper within, with some hinting at an attempt to computerize the entire planet, to be powered by those generators. Intentional or not, because of the still active session the crew managed to extract databanks about the species who vanished from that planet as well as the workings of the geothermal generators which had kept the complex running all these years."
 NewAnomalyEvents.230.Name: "Hacking Successful: Geothermal Generators"
 NewAnomalyEvents.231.Desc: "The crew finally managed to hack the lone computer. A loud creaking sound suddenly filled the room and slowly yet surely a large Hangar door previously obscured by layers of millennia-old dust began to open, a giant storage room filled with what could only be identified as near countless armies of battle androids in various stages of disrepair waiting for someone to become their leader. It is not yet to known what the true purpose of these armies was, yet the local engineering experts are certain that at least a few of them could find one anew, serving us in battle if needed."
 NewAnomalyEvents.231.Name: "Hacking Successful: Android Armies"
 NewAnomalyEvents.231.a: "Take control of android armies."
 NewAnomalyEvents.231.b: "Scrap the android armies."
 NewAnomalyEvents.232.Desc: "The crew finally managed to hack the lone computer. A team of Linguists and Computer experts were able to determine that it seems to be some sort of terraforming program linked to several hidden ships in orbit on standby, ready to be initialised at any point. There are no clues as to what the ideal planet for the species who created the terraforming program could be yet it is likely to at least share a similar atmospheric composition since no signs of airlocks or airtight 'suits' were found in the control room. The crew are waiting for orders"
 NewAnomalyEvents.232.Name: "Hacking Successful: Terraforming Protocol"
 NewAnomalyEvents.232.a: "Take control of the ships."
 NewAnomalyEvents.232.b: "Scrap the ships."
 NewAnomalyEvents.233.Desc: "The crew finally managed to hack the lone computer. Only a database labeled 'Reshli Na'tak' was found, inside it a stunning amount of holotapes showing different sceneries and members of their species in countless situations, ranging from what resembles purely scientific approaches to what seem to be a domestic households. Linguistic analysts have been able to determine that the label would best translate into 'Our Civilization' with the database being some sort of all-encompassing Civilisatory Archive. It appears that they were a xenophilic society and set this up so that to anyone intelligent enough to hack the security system of the computer would be able to learn about their civilization in full. A research station near the planet could establish a link with the it allowing the team to continue the research from orbit."
 NewAnomalyEvents.233.Name: "Hacking Successful: Archive"
 NewAnomalyEvents.240.Desc: "A giant factory was found inside the lava citadel, and luckily it appears to still be functioning and ready to be activated. The facility is exceptionally well designed and could sustain the mass production of almost any sort of material or item and at stunning speeds. The research team decided that the best approach would be to study it from orbit with a research station to investigate how these engineers managed to build something this efficient."
 NewAnomalyEvents.240.Name: "Giant Old Factory"
 NewAnomalyEvents.250.Desc: "Beautiful crystals outline the interior of the ice cave, wondrously glistering in the sunlight for the first time in millennia. Even though to fragile for industrial use, they will probably fetch a high price on our markets."
 NewAnomalyEvents.250.Name: "Crystal Loot"
 NewAnomalyEvents.251.Desc: "A civilization of ice entities has been found to reside in the large glistering ice cave. Surprisingly, they don't seem to be bothered by the presence of the scientific team which will allow us to observe their complex social behaviors for further study."
 NewAnomalyEvents.251.Name: "Ice Entities"
 NewAnomalyEvents.252.Desc: "An unusually translucent and perfectly cubic block of ice lies in the middle of the frozen cave, yet despite its innocent appearance nothing in our arsenal could even splinter off a fragment it. Luckily, it is unusually light which allowed us to carry it in back onto ship to transport it back home for further research."
 NewAnomalyEvents.252.Name: "Perfect Ice"
 NewAnomalyEvents.260.Desc: "After a long investigation, an ancient precursor building was found. Inside is a giant terminal, still active and probably the reason for the mysterious activities present on the planet. After an initial delay during exploration the scientific team located a giant switch waiting to be activated. After a long time of inspection, discussion and speculation they finally decided to activate the mechanism. A giant earthquake started on the entire planet which started miraculously expanding its surface area over time, but the most amazing part was the height of several geological landforms which started to raise at an amazing rate creating hundreds of mountains with abnormal volcanic activity, converting the entire planet into an alpine world in hours."
 NewAnomalyEvents.260.Name: "Mountain World Discovered"
 NewAnomalyEvents.261.Desc: "After a long investigation, an ancient precursor building was found. Inside is a giant terminal, still active and probably the reason for the mysterious activities present on the planet. After an initial delay during exploration the scientific team located a giant switch waiting to be activated. After a long time of inspection, discussion and speculation they finally decided to activate the mechanism. A giant earthquake started on the entire planet which started miraculously expanding its surface area over time, but the most amazing part was the surface which started to crack revealing bountiful amounts of minerals ready to be exploited. Unfortunately, this cracked the planet in the process, leaving it shattered."
 NewAnomalyEvents.261.Name: "Cracked World Discovered"
 NewAnomalyEvents.262.Desc: "After a long investigation, an ancient precursor building was found. Inside is a giant terminal, still active and probably the reason for the mysterious activities present on the planet. After an initial delay during exploration the scientific team located a giant switch waiting to be activated. After a long time of inspection, discussion and speculation they finally decided to activate the mechanism. A giant earthquake started on the entire planet which started miraculously expanding its surface area over time, but the most amazing part was the surface which after spreading started to reveal a lot of jungles, swamps and kelps. Many species of wildlife also started to emerge from underground including some of which likes we had never seen in the past. This planet appears to be an abandoned Subterranean Preserve World of Enigmatic Observers."
 NewAnomalyEvents.262.Name: "Preserve World Discovered"
 NewAnomalyEvents.263.Desc: "After a long investigation, an ancient precursor building was found. Inside is a giant terminal, still active and probably the reason for the mysterious activities present on the planet. After an initial delay during exploration the scientific team located a giant switch waiting to be activated. After a long time of inspection, discussion and speculation they finally decided to activate the mechanism. A giant earthquake started on the entire planet which started miraculously expanding its surface area over time, but the most amazing part was the surface which started to break and reveal machinery spanning through entire inside of the planet. Many secret sectors also started to appear and the team decided to leave the planet in order to look at it from space. This is planet was revealed to actually be a giant Subterranean Machine World."
