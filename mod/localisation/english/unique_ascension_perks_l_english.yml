 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.1060.VeryAmused: "§R..\n\nTo be honest I was not expecting that you would have the courage or be crazy enough to insult me, knowing who I am and having witnessed the might of my mere minions. You Mortals never fail to amuse me with your oddities. As a present I will allow you foolish fools to summon one of my Leviathans as a gift, as a reminder of my might.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.1060.VeryPissed: "§RWell, well, well Mortals what a funny joke that is. Quasi-Stellar Obliterator? What does that even mean? You know what? I also have a funny joke for you... I hope that your systems are perfectly defended because it may be possible that some of my Minions would like to take a little vacation in your capital system. And I never refuse vacation requests. This is what I call a joke, and unlike your imaginary constructs it actually exists. Have fun.§!"

We are impressed that someone has finally managed to find and contact us, as it has been millions of years since we have talked with any other empire. This means that you also should not be surprised if our diplomacy is kind of out-dated. Yet we are sure that if you have come here, you came for something, and that you are going to ask us some sort of request. Before you do anything like that we would like you to give us food... We don't need to eat anymore, but the Mind would like to taste food once again, especially food a Hivemind such as you has produced. Feed us and you might get the reward you deserve.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.113.Desc: "§GThank you fellow Hivemind. As a reward for your cooperation we are now going to show you the way to enter our realm.

## Odd chest choice descs
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Chest: "We have reached some sort of isolated island featuring a temple-like construct in its middle. Deep inside its hallways we have managed to locate three chests of different colors. A strange wall of non-identified energy began to form all around us, and it seems that the realm wants us to open one of the three chests. Their color changed after this request, one turning blue, another one yellow and the last one red. Now, a vocal transmission coming from no identifiable origin is telling us that all chests contain the same treasure but in different quantities, and that we can only open one. Which chest should we chose?"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Chest.Bad: "As we begin to open one of the chests, the other two are sucked into some kind of micro-wormhole. The chest is near-empty and only contains a meager prize, but we can't take our choice back. An exit is forming behind us and the strange voices are telling us to leave. It seems that our adventures are over for the moment."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Chest.Good: "As we begin to open one of the chests, the other two are sucked into some kind of micro-wormhole. The chest is filled to the brim with valuable treasures, and the strange voices hum in what we presume to be an expression of pride. An exit is forming behind us and the strange voices are telling us to leave with our spoils. It seems that our adventures are over for the moment."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Chest.Medium: "As we begin to open one of the chests, the other two are sucked into some kind of micro-wormhole. The chest is filled with treasure which will probably fetch a respectable prize, but we somehow know that we could have found more than this. An exit is forming behind us and the strange voices are telling us to leave. It seems that our adventures are over for the moment."

## Dimensional Dropper descs (Its a good and thematic name)
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Dropper: "Some sort of house-like building has been spotted in front of us, and we have found what we presume to be a drone of the $ap_mega_hive_mind$ inside, standing in front of what seems to be a sort of casino machine. The door behind us has locked itself and we have not been able to locate any other exits.\n\n§GYoung Hivemind, it seems as if like you have managed to find the 'Dimensional Dropper', an arcane construct your Mind is unlikely to ever understand. While you won't be able to go back outside onto your former path, I shall give you the choice between activating the Dropper or simply leaving.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Dropper.Activated: "§GThe Dimensional Dropper has been activated, and while we cannot predict what kind of effect this will have we hope that you have received something interesting.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Dropper.Deactivated: "§GIt unfortunately seems as if the Dimensional Dropper won't work until the next time. It seems as if you will have to go home for now, young Hivemind.§!"

## Elevator encounter descs and names
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Elevator: "We have detected a structure which looks like some sort of natural staircase, and we could use it to go up and down into the unknown or alternatively just avoid it and continue on forward."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter: "We have found what we presume to be one of the $ap_mega_hive_mind$ drones on one of the floors. Should we communicate with it or rather just leave the realm?"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Breeder: "§GHere we meet again young Hivemind, and it appears that you are managing to keep up with the unpredictable dangers of our realm.\n\nThis drone here is called 'Alfana the Breeder', and they are one of the rare drones in our $ap_mega_hive_mind$ that are able to stimulate other drones breeding abilities. These drones are very useful whenever we discover a new place to colonize in our realm. It has been centuries since we last needed her abilities, so you may have her. But be careful, as using this power with all the breeders of your empire may be dangerous since it might not be able to support the rapid population growth.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Failure: "§GHmm... It seems that the process was a complete failure. I don't know how even a young Hivemind like you managed to fail something as easy as this. Maybe you are not ready yet to come here. You will have to make it through with this malus, and we wish you good luck regardless.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Farmer: "§GHere we meet again young Hivemind, and it appears that you are managing to keep up with the unpredictable dangers of our realm.\n\nThis drone here is called 'Aliquior the Botanist', and thanks to them we were able master the secrets of any plant species life-cycle when we still had need of that. Since we don't need food anymore we shall share them and their secrets with you for a given amount of time. But be careful, we can't guarantee that you will be able to support your drones sustenance needs after they leave.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Hunter: "§GHere we meet again young Hivemind, and it appears that you are managing to keep up with the unpredictable dangers of our realm.\n\nThis drone here is called 'Sarge the Hunter', and they have spend most of their time domesticating and training abomination-like alien species. They are completely under his control and he wouldn't mind giving some of them to you, however we can't be sure wether you will be able to take control of them easily. The more of these pets you request, the higher will be the chances for them eventually turning against you.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Hunter.Failure: "§GAs expected you failed to domesticate the swarm, and they are now going to rampage in your territory. We hope that you have a navy force strong enough to stop them.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Hunter.Success: "§GWe are impresses, young Hivemind! You did actually managed to domesticate our swarm pets. They are yours now, and you can do whatever you want with it.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Perfect: "Amazing! The results of the process are even better than what we expected of a young Hivemind like you. With such an advantage you can be sure that the other empires in your galaxy won't see their demise until it is too late."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Researcher.Engineering: "§GHere we meet again young Hivemind, and it appears that you are managing to keep up with the unpredictable dangers of our realm.\n\nThis drone here is called 'Alexander III the Engineer', and they are responsible for keeping most of our knowledge in engineering and act as a data bank for the $ap_mega_hive_mind$ when other drones need to refresh their knowledge of that domain. We could establish a link between your Hivemind and them but there is a chances for it to totally fail and result in a scientific catastrophe.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Researcher.Physics: "§GHere we meet again young Hivemind, and it appears that you are managing to keep up with the unpredictable dangers of our realm.\n\nThis drone here is called 'Alexander I the Physicist', and they are responsible for keeping most of our knowledge in physics and act as a data bank for the $ap_mega_hive_mind$ when other drones need to refresh their knowledge of that domain.

 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Researcher.Society: "§GHere we meet again young Hivemind, and it appears that you are managing to keep up with the unpredictable dangers of our realm.\n\nThis drone here is called 'Alexander II the Sociologist', and they are responsible for keeping most of our knowledge in sociology and act as a data bank for the $ap_mega_hive_mind$ when other drones need to refresh their knowledge of that domain. We could establish a link between your Hivemind and them but there is a chance for it to totally fail and result in a scientific catastrophe.§!"
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.114.Encounter.Success: "§GInteresting... It seems that the process was a success. It seems that the young Hivemind is lucky today, and you can now return to your galaxy with this reward.§!"

## DS Random tech
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.173.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have made an interesting discovery in the Deep Space.

 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.173.Name: "Deep Space Discovery: Technology Cache"

## DS Free Void Fleet
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.174.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have encountered an inactive fleet of vessels which seem to be abandoned. After a close inspection to ensure that there are no hidden mechanisms, signs of crew or any other indication of it being a trap or potentially dangerous, our scientists and engineers concluded that the ships should be safe for taking. The new crews we subsequently assigned to man these ships may have to get used to the unfamiliar controls and bizarre alien language used in these ships, but they should be able to serve us just as well as our other vessels."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.174.Name: "Deep Space Encounter: Abandoned Fleet"

## DS Jump Drive Spaceborne Aliens
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.175.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have encountered some strange spaceborne alien species in deep space, never encountered before by any of our Hyplerlane-bound science teams. Our scientists kept a safe distance to study it while ensuring that it had no hostile intentions, and initially simply tried to scan the alien. Unfortunately, the organism proved sensitive to our close-range sensors and seemingly just vanished before their eyes after the scans started. While the science team presumed it to have some sort of natural cloaking abilities which simply eluded our sensors at first, they were taken it shock when long-range sensor readings showed its life signature of more than a solar system away. The alien must possess some sort of biological Jump Drive, unlike other spaceborne aliens which usually possessed a Hyperlane-bound Bio-Drive. Even though its jumping ability and scanner sensitivity prevent us from actually analysing its biology, we must share this groundbreaking discovery with the rest of the empire and the galaxy!"

After a close inspection to ensure that there are no hidden mechanisms, signs of crew or any other indication of it being a trap or potentially dangerous, our scientists and engineers concluded that the ship should be safe for taking. The new crew we subsequently assigned to man the ship may have to get used to the unfamiliar controls and bizarre alien language used in the Titan, but they should be able to serve us just as well as any other vessel."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.176.Name: "Deep Space Encounter: Abandoned Titan"

## DS Machan-Shan
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.177.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have encountered what was presumably a pirate fleet of unknown origin. The shabby pirate vessels of wildly varying designs, decorated with what seem to be skulls and bones of several unknown species immediately started to move towards our expedition ships and opened fire. Thanks to our extensive preparations, our vessels were well armed enough to defend themselves against the pirates, and their fleet has been destroyed with minimum casualties on our side. We seized all resources we could salvage from their shipwrecks, and are now prepared to continue as usual, even if maybe just a bit more cautious than before."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.177.Name: "Deep Space Encounter: Pirate Ships"

## DS Angry Spaceborne Aliens
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.178.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have encountered hostile spaceborne aliens which started to attack us without warning. A fully-fledged battle ensued in the deep space and in the end we barely managed to chase them away, leaving several giant corpses amongst metal debris from our own ships behind. While their carcasses look very peculiar and we initially hoped that we could their unique biology to gain some kind of lasting advantage, the team of biologists present in the expedition assured us that while unfortunately not useful for any industrial or military applications, they would be somewhat edible if properly processed. So we are at least not going back home empty-handed..."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.178.Name: "Deep Space Encounter: Hostile Spaceborne Aliens"

## DS Accidental Space Battle
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.179.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have encountered a fleet composed of unidentified vessels featuring a general structure similar to our own ship classes. We received some kind of agitated transmission from what we presume to have been the Admiral of the fleet, and despite our translators attempts to conjure up some kind of ceasefire proposal and initiate a proper first contact, they quickly started to open fire onto our ships, not recognizing that we mean no harm. We managed to put up a decent fight while continuously frantically hailing them in order to clear up the misunderstanding, and eventually got patched through after their fleets flagship was destroyed. Who we presume to be a high-ranking captain of one of the surviving ships turned out to be more diplomatically inclined and actually decided to listen to us, accepting our proposal for a ceasefire and initiating proper communications. \n\nIt turns out that they mistook us for a fleet of §R"Machan-Shan"§! who are apparently some sort of nomadic pirates even more barbaric then our galaxies Marauder clans, going so far as to cover their vessels with bones and corpses from any crew they capture, since they did not recognize our ships designs and the Machan-Shan tend to use whatever they can scavenge. Recognizing that we simply acted in self-defence, they offered us some resources as recompense for the incident before retreating back into the void."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.179.Name: "Deep Space Encounter: Unknown Fleet"

## DS Nanite Ships
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.180.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have encountered a strange fleet composed of vessels made out of nanites. We neither received lifesigns nor communications from the odd fleet, and they started to open fire almost immediately, leading into a huge space battle. We have miraculously managed to defeat them in the end, and our battered science vessels have started to study the remains of these strange ships in an attempt to find anything interesting or valuable."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.180.Name: "Deep Space Encounter: Nanite Ships"

## DS Automated Ships
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.181.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have encountered a strange fleet composed of autonomous strange vessels operating without any organic or mechanical pilots. We assume that the enemy fleet was acting upon some sort of pre-scripted defense protocols, opening fire almost immediately and ignoring any attempts to communicate with them, leading into a huge space battle. Our well-armed expedition ships managed to take the vessels down with minimal causalities, and our scientists are now studying the debris to find anything interesting or valuable. "
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.181.Name: "Deep Space Encounter: Autonomous Ships"

## DS Void Leviathan
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.182.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have encountered some sort of giant monstrosity living in the deep void. It immediately started attacking the expedition and destroyed several of our vessels before the remnants of our forces managed to engage their emergency FTLs. The surviving forces confirmed that it seemingly took near-to-no damage from our weapons and overwhelmed our defenses with little effort. We will study it further by analysing what sensor data survived the battle, and will share this menacing discovery with the rest of the empire and the galaxy."
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.182.Name: "Deep Space Encounter: Space Monstrosity"

## DS Void Horror
 UniqueAscensionPerksEvents.183.Desc: "Our expedition vessels have encountered something unimaginable in the void. A massive leviathan-class entity partially stuck in a black hole has apparently been waiting for us to get closer, tricking us by somehow manipulating our initial sensor readings. The massive monster dubbed §R"Void Horror"§! by the surviving crew managed to destroy many of our ships before they managed to engage their emergency FTLs. While much of our fleet has been lost, we were still able to discover some interesting things by analysing what little sensor data survived."

Our leaders and population report levels of consciousness never experienced before, with some comparing the even further improved experience of consciousness to expanding a room both inwards and outwards simultaneously, yet mentally and not quite describable with words. While many of our scientists initially believed this to simply be a way of improving our Neural Networks to peak efficiency, it is becoming apparent that our improvement of consciousness itself is going far beyond that, §Band that it has not even reached its full potential yet§!. Furthermore, several of our aspiring recruits for leadership positions have stated to have developed extraordinary skills and abilities during their "Mental Ascensions", just as we predicted. The overall number of reports in our populace about these often highly individual "Ascended Skills" is ever increasing, and an initial analysis has shown that they usually lead to improved performance in their respective occupations, even though there are not yet enough of them to make a notable difference. While we are still unable to uphold states of "Mental Ascension" continuously, we are confident that it will §Gonly be a matter of time before we can achieve that§!.
