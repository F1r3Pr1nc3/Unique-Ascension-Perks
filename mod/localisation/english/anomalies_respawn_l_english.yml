 AnomaliesRespawnEvent.2001.Desc: "It appears that some planets in our territory which appeared at the first place to have nothing interesting for us were instead hiding some interesting anomalies ready to be investigated."
 AnomaliesRespawnEvent.2001.Name: "§BNew Anomalies Discovered§!"
 NewAnomalyEvents.100.Desc: "The rotational velocity relative to the galactic plane of this star is not consistent with the other A class stars encountered before. After a long observational period the crew tried to describe that unprecedented behavior and to the surprise of the scientific crew, all the movement of that star could only be compared to one of a lost cell idling in the space. Could it be a proof that our universe maybe be infinitely big? Who knows?"
 NewAnomalyEvents.100.Name: "A Star moving like a Cell"
 NewAnomalyEvents.110.Desc: "The composition of this B class is unique, it appears that a simple beam laser is able to create a strange thermal disruption within the star leaving a permanent mark. In the end our scientist crew decided to add the great name of our civilization in order to prove to the next generations coming in the future millennials that we were present and advanced enough to discover such an amazing process."
 NewAnomalyEvents.110.Name: "Writable Star"
 NewAnomalyEvents.111.Desc: "After sending screenshots of that new discovered star to our people it appears that many people influential in our society wanted to have their name put on that star. The buzz created by that B class was strong enough to classify it as very important and making it able to generate influence."
 NewAnomalyEvents.111.Name: "The Star of the Stars"
 NewAnomalyEvents.120.Desc: "At the first it sounds very illogical but After vigorous inspection we can confirm that this star is acting like a living organism able to groom itself up from interstellar debris able to resist the huge heat coming from it. We can only speculate that it is trying to maintain a good appearance, but for who?"
 NewAnomalyEvents.120.Name: "Living Star"
 NewAnomalyEvents.130.Desc: "An abandoned energy harvesting station composed of unknown material of unprecedented strength has been located near this G class star, it seems to be deactivated for an unknown amount of time. Our scientific staff wasn't able to active it again but we found a large stockpile of energy which was probably constructed in order to keep the station active even after the death of that star. Something which won't happen for billions of years so we decided to use that energy for our own purposes."
 NewAnomalyEvents.130.Name: "Energy Station"
 NewAnomalyEvents.140.Desc: "We have located a very weak signal coming from this K class star, and it appears that an engineering outpost has been detected directly inside the stars. But the most interesting part is the fact that some people of an unknown species are inside and doesn't seem to like having us around for a long time. As they know that we can't reach them, they decided to share some interesting engineering data in exchange for leaving them and never returning."
 NewAnomalyEvents.140.Name: "Engineers Inside"
 NewAnomalyEvents.150.Desc: "A drifting box has been located near this M class star, composed of materials strong enough to resist the heat of the star but with a very weak security system allowing us to open it very easily and find a gorgeous treasure inside."
 NewAnomalyEvents.150.Name: "Drifting Box"
 NewAnomalyEvents.151.Desc: "This M class star is somehow able to create an attractive magnetic field at least strong enough to capture most of the mineral dust around forming a mineral cloud big enough to be harvested."
 NewAnomalyEvents.160.Desc: "A weak signal was coming from a very small passage near that black hole. After a closer inspection we found something horrific and repulsive that is impossible to describe with other words. The crew are convinced, that monster was trying to reach our galaxy. But our scientific team kept their heads cool and managed to close the small gate linking us to the realm of that horror by launching a projectile at a very high speed which quickly created a chain reaction with the energy of the black hole and sealed the passage forever."
 NewAnomalyEvents.160.Name: "Avoided Disaster"
 NewAnomalyEvents.170.Desc: "This pulsar is much larger than most of the ones we previously encountered, the energy coming out of is exceptional. And it took only a few days for the engineering team to make a device working like a solar panel which managed to absorb a lot of energy ready to be exploited for us."
 NewAnomalyEvents.170.Name: "Super Pulsar"
 NewAnomalyEvents.180.Desc: "This solar system is very rich in mineral dust but as they were too small gathering them all would take centuries. Instead our science crew have an idea, they knew that these dust minerals could all be attracted with the help of the neutron star with this magnetic attraction. And after managing to stimulate that attracting field we managed to gather a huge amount of minerals ready to be collected."
 NewAnomalyEvents.180.Name: "Attracting Minerals"
 NewAnomalyEvents.190.Desc: "No interesting traces of the previous civilization which was on this planet has been found but some beautiful and valuable pieces of art which could be sold at high value to the people of our society."

 NewAnomalyEvents.191.Desc: "We have found a huge data bank still active but very damaged, the only informations that we were able to extract were some sort of special methods on how to influence the population and their factions in order to have the maximum amount of them on our side."
 NewAnomalyEvents.191.Name: "Master of Propaganda"
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.Desc: "Something very bad happened here, the only suspicious things present in that city where the clothes of his inhabitants, the material of these clothes doesn't seem to be affected by the time and could be useful for us. But because of it we are not able to estimate when the tragedy happened here, the only clue we found was a note in the pocket of one of a citizen's clothes which, after a serious translation, said they had fought together and with unity until the end. It is impossible to say today who was their enemy but something certain is the fact that we should seriously take example of their bravery."
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.Name: "Until the End"
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.a: "We will honor them."
 NewAnomalyEvents.192.b: "Take the clothes and leave."
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.Desc: "We can be sure that the inhabitants of that city were very 'well-to-do', but something forced them to abandon their planet very quickly and that before having the time to take all their fortune. We won't be able to take all the treasures that they left behind and many ships of what appear to be smugglers have been spotted which mean that they are going to loot everything remaining here. We must leave as soon as possible, and so what is the choice?"
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.Name: "Rich City"
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.a: "Take the money."
 NewAnomalyEvents.193.b: "Take the minerals."
 NewAnomalyEvents.200.Desc: "The corpse of this colossus was fascinating, our scientific crew was not even able to explain exactly how this very strange creature could use the properties of exotic physics at a level far beyond our knowledge. The only thing we could do is an estimation of the velocity achieved by the creature's skeleton which started to slowly appear thanks to decomposition. Such a discovery will help us a lot in the understanding of physics."
 NewAnomalyEvents.200.Name: "Advanced Creature"
 NewAnomalyEvents.201.Desc: "We have found something very fascinating on the surface of that body, it appears that the skin is composed of jewels able to resist the body decomposition. It is hard to determine if these jewels are natural or if they are the result of collision with space debris but in the end they have a good value and can be collected."
 NewAnomalyEvents.201.Name: "Skin of Jewels"
 NewAnomalyEvents.202.Desc: "We have detected some activity inside the dead space organism. After a long discussion the crew decided to open a hole large enough to check what is inside without allowing it break free. And what we found were some passive Tiyanki Space Whales. The most interesting part is the fact that they seemed to thank us for helping them to break free by doing a sort of dance, and they are actually following us which will help the study of their specie."
 NewAnomalyEvents.202.Name: "Tiyankis Inside"
 NewAnomalyEvents.203.Desc: "This is something you don't see everyday, even after it's death which can be dated to many centuries before the dead body of the creature is still regenerating from any damage taken. So a good question could be asked here, is that monster dead or not ? Fear started to take over the ship and the crew decided to leave as soon as possible but in the end they still managed to make a very interesting study of the regenerating corpse and claim that we could do the same with our ships."
 NewAnomalyEvents.203.Name: "Regenerating Corpse"

 NewAnomalyEvents.211.Name: "Abandoned Treasure"
 NewAnomalyEvents.212.Desc: "The astrocartographic chart gave us the location of an abandoned primitive structure which appeared to be a robotics factory. We have found inside an ancient machine of a very crude design who challenged us to a game which seemed to be analogous to chess from our own civilization. After losing some rounds we finally managed to defeat the machine and as a reward it gave us some blueprints to let us know how these primitive engineers managed to develop artificial intelligence so soon."
 NewAnomalyEvents.212.Name: "Old Machine"
 NewAnomalyEvents.213.Desc: "The astrocartographic chart gave us the location of a giant deactivated powerplant. After turning it on the huge amount of energy generated from it was so amazing that the engineering crew confirmed that it could be exploited from space with a mining station."
 NewAnomalyEvents.213.Name: "A Power Plant"
 NewAnomalyEvents.220.Desc: "A spaceborn alien was found trapped in the micro-wormhole, if nothing was done that creature was going to be killed. After a close inspection of the wormhole the crew estimated that the spaceborn alien wasn't hostile and so they decided to help it escape with the help of a grappling hook and thrusters of the science vessel. The rescue was very satisfying for the crew and the creature rewarded them with a very beautiful sound, the crew remained stunned in front of it and allowing the little creature to escape."
 NewAnomalyEvents.220.Name: "Trapped Alien"
 NewAnomalyEvents.221.Desc: "A strange device was found in the other side of the micro-wormhole. It is impossible to explain the purpose of the object but something interesting is the secondary purposes which functioned as a multi-tool kit with a large number of functions."

 NewAnomalyEvents.222.Desc: "A very big sapphire has been found in the other side of the micro-wormhole, the size of the sapphire is close to that of one of our own species and the crew believe it can be collected. While they still have no idea of how that jewel ended up here but the value of it in the market is going to be very lucrative."
 NewAnomalyEvents.222.Name: "Journeying Sapphire"
 NewAnomalyEvents.223.Desc: "That mini wormhole was in the end not natural but artificial and the source of it was quickly spotted. The reserve of energy which appeared to be very low could explain why the wormhole was so small and still shrinking little by little. So in the end the crew decided to extract the rest of the energy present inside before it being depleted once for all."
 NewAnomalyEvents.223.Name: "Unknown Generator"
 NewAnomalyEvents.230.Desc: "The crew finally managed to hack the lone computer. It appears that even after thousands of years the session of the man who was on that computer beforehand remained open because that genius managed to create an energy reactor with a storage large enough to keep it online for an eternity. In the end thanks to the hack the crew managed to extract informations on the species who vanished from that planet as well as the functioning of the reactor to shut the computer once and for all."
 NewAnomalyEvents.230.Name: "Hacking Successful: Reactor Core"
 NewAnomalyEvents.231.Desc: "The crew finally managed to hack the lone computer. And something amazing happened, a giant secret storage room opened itself and what was inside were many armies of battle androids waiting for someone to become their leader.

 NewAnomalyEvents.233.Desc: "The crew finally managed to hack the lone computer. Only a folder called 'Our Civilization' was found, inside it a huge amount of videos explaining every single detail on how the species present on that planet lived. It appears that they were xenophilic and decided to share all informations to anyone intelligent enough to hack the security system of the computer. A research station near the planet could establish a link with the it allowing the team to continue the research from orbit."
 NewAnomalyEvents.233.Name: "Hacking Successful: Documentary"
 NewAnomalyEvents.240.Desc: "A giant factory was found inside the lava citadel, it appears to still be functioning and ready to be activated.

 NewAnomalyEvents.252.Desc: "A big block of ice was there laying in the middle of the frozen cave and what made it very special is the fact that nothing of our arsenal could break it but it's weight was very light allowing us to carry it in our ship and bring it to our world for decoration purpose."
 NewAnomalyEvents.252.Name: "Perfect Ice"
 NewAnomalyEvents.260.Desc: "After a long investigation, an ancient precursor building was found. Inside it a giant terminal was still active probably being the main center of the mysterious activities present on the planet. After a certain delay of exploration the scientific team located a giant switch waiting to be activated and here after a long time of inspection, discussion and speculation they finally decided to activate the mechanism. A giant earth quake started on the entire planet making it grow bigger with time, but the most amazing part was the height of the ground which started to raise at an amazing rate spawning hundreds of mountain with inside them huge volcanic activity."
